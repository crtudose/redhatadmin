### Manage users and groups

1. Create, delete, and modify local user accounts

    * RHEL 8 supports three user account types: root, normal and service. The root user has full access to all services and administrative functions. A normal user can run applications and programs that they are authorised to execute. Service accounts are responsible for taking care of the installed services.

    * The `/etc/passwd` file contains vital user login data.

    * The `/etc/shadow` file is readable only by the root user and contains user authentication information. Each row in the file corresponds to one entry in the passwd file. The password expiry settings are defined in the `/etc/login.defs` file. The `/etc/defaults/useradd` file contains defaults for the *useradd* command.

    * The `/etc/group` file contains the group information. Each row in the file stores one group entry.

    * The `/etc/gshadow` file stores encrypted group passwords. Each row in the file corresponds to one entry in the group file.

    * Due to manual modification, inconsistencies may arise between the above four authentication files. The *pwck* command is used to check for inconsistencies.

    * The *vipw* and *vigr* commands are used to modify the *passwd* and *group* files, respectively. These commands disable write access to these files while the privileged user is making the modifications.

    * To create a user:
        ```shell
        useradd user1
        ```
    
    * To check that the user has been created:
        ```shell
        cat /etc/group | grep user1
        ```

    * To specify the UID and GID at user creation:
        ```shell
        useradd -u 1010 -g 1005 user1
        ```

    * To create a user and add them to a group:
        ```shell
        useradd -G IT user2
        ```

	* Note that *-G* is a secondary group, and *-g* is the primary group. The primary group is the group that the operating system assigns to files to which a user belongs. A secondary group is one or more other groups to which a user also belongs. 

    * To delete a user:
        ```shell
        userdel user1
        ```

    * To modify a user:
        ```shell 
        usermod -l user5 user1 # note that home directory will remain as user1
        ```

    * To add a user but not give access to the shell:
        ```shell 
        useradd -s /sbin/nologin user
        ```

1. Change passwords and adjust password aging for local user accounts

    * To change the password for a user:
        ```shell 
        passwd user1
        ```

    * To step through password aging information the *chage* command can be used without any options.

    * To view user password expiry information:
        ```shell 
        chage -l user1
        ```

    * To set the password expiry for a user 30 days from now:
        ```shell 
        chage -M 30 user1
        ```

    * To set the password expiry date:
        ```shell 
        chage -E 2021-01-01 user1
        ```

    * To set the password to never expire:
        ```shell 
        chage -E -1 user1
        ```

1. Create, delete, and modify local groups and group memberships

    * To create a group:
        ```shell 
        groupadd IT
        ```

    * To create a group with a specific GID:
        ```shell 
        groupadd -g 3032
        ```

    * To delete a group:
        ```shell 
        groupdel IT
        ```

    * To modify the name of a group:
        ```shell 
        groupmod -n IT-Support IT
        ```

    * To modify the GID of a group:
        ```shell 
        groupmod -g 3033 IT-Support
        ```

    * To add a user to a group:
        ```shell 
        groupmod -aG IT-Support user1
        ```

    * To view the members of a group:
        ```shell 
        groupmems -l -g IT-Support
        ```

    * To remove a user from a group:
        ```shell 
        gpasswd -d user1 IT-Support
        ```

1. Configure superuser access

    * To view the sudoers file:
        ```shell 
        visudo /etc/sudoers
        ```

    * Members of the wheel group can use sudo on all commands. To add a user to the wheel group:
        ```shell 
        sudo usermod -aG wheel user1
        ```

    * To allow an individual user sudo access to specific commands:
        ```shell
        visudo /etc/sudoers
        user2 ALL=(root) /bin/ls, /bin/df -h, /bin/date
        ```
